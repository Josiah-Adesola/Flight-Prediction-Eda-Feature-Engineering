# Flight-Prediction-Eda-Feature-Engineering


This flight prediction project is not for testing with Machine Learning model.

I worked on it for successful Data Preparation. 

Two major processes were used here

# 1. Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a process of restructuring your data, removing outliers, removing missing values and replacements, encoding categorical variables and the likes.

These operations were performed in this ipynb file.

# 2. Feature Engineering

This is a very important operation in Data Science and Machine Learning Projects. I had to re-engineer features to the correct form. I did feature engineering on the Arrival dates, Departure Dates, Durations, these features are so important to predict the price of the plane.

It's a very interesting and educating project.

Check it out and make comment and feel free to fork it.
